# JSDB
JSDB attempts to be a SQL lite database written entirely in JavaScript. 
This is purely an experiment for my own learning experience but I hope that down the line, JSDB becomes a tool that people
could use (in theory).

Currently, JSDB only works through its command line interface.

# Installation

### Prerequisites
[Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) needs to be installed. Note that the code base is written in ECMAScript 6 and runs using
[Babel](http://babeljs.io/). Though included in [package.json](https://github.com/srbdev/jsdb/blob/master/package.json),
Babel can be installed globally via the command:

    $ npm install -g babel

### Install
Follow these steps to install and run JSDB:

    $ git clone https://github.com/srbdev/jsdb.git
    $ cd jsdb
    $ npm install
    $ babel-node index.js
    jsdb>
